## Localization:
localization : initial belief --> sense --> move --> sense --> move

i.e. : initial belief --> ( back & forth : sense <--> move )

move loses info

sense gains info

* belief = probability
* sense = multiplication followed by normalization
* move = addition (convolution)

## Bayes Rule, for Localization:
p(A|B) = p(A) * p(B|A) / p(B)

p(Xi|M) = p(Xi) * p(M|Xi) / p(M)
* (let Xi = probability of being at a given position xi)
* (let M = probability of getting a given measurement)

p(Xi|M) = prior * measurement probability / p(M)

p(M) = normalization constant

p(M) = sum over i of ( p(Xi) * p(M|Xi) )

So: p(Xi|M) = p(Xi) * p(M|Xi) / sum over i of ( p(Xi) * p(M|Xi) )

## Theorem of Total Probabiltiy, for Motion:
p(A) = p(B) * p(A|B)

p(Xit) = sum over j of ( p(Xjt-1) * p(Xi|Xj) )
* (let t = current time stamp)
* (let t-1 = previous time stamp)

# Comparing Filters:

Filters:                 | Histogram Filters  | Kalman Filters                  | Particle Filters
------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---
State Space              | discrete           | continuous :)                   | continuous :)
Belief 'Bumps' Allowed   | multimodal :)      | unimodal                        | multimodal :)
Algorithm Efficiency     | exponential (dims) | quadratic :)                    | ? (keep =< 4 dimensions)
Robot Position Accuracy  | approx. (discrete) | approx. (linear vs. non-linear) | approximate

**Histogram Filter**:  Measurement Updates

Approximate / proportional

P(X|Z) <- P(Z|X) P(X)

P(X|Z) <-(resampling)- importance weights * particles

**Kalman Filter**:  Motion Updates

Gaussians

P(X') = sum ( P(X'|X) P(X) )

P(X') = sum of each ( sample * particle )

But the key advantage of particle filters is: easy to program. :)

**Google Car**:

Histogram Methods + Particle Methods

Robot model:  2 stationary, 2 non-stationary wheels.  "Bicycle model" because half of it stationary/non wheels.

Sensor data:  map (not landmarks) <- match with snapshots.

Additional sensors:  GPS, inertial, etc.

## Particle Filter:

Per "guess" particle: (x,y,direction) --> particles --> approx. posterior probability representation of position

**"Survival of the fittest 'guess' particles" (with min(real-guess) or max(importance wts)** --> resample (cluster --> cluster) with higher-importance particles being **more likely** (not guaranteed) to be chosen and copied multiple times.
